## About The Project

In an age of online learning and video content, simply watching is not enough. This tool was built for students, professionals, and lifelong learners who need to engage deeply with video content. Whether you're studying a lecture, following a complex tutorial, or analyzing media, this sidebar provides the integrated tools you need, right where you need them.

The sidebar automatically attaches to your active YouTube video, providing a dedicated workspace for playback control, free-form summaries, and precise, timestamped annotations. All notes are saved per video and automatically loaded when you return, creating a persistent, organized library of your insights.

## Core Features
