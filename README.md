## About The Project

This tool was born from the need to do more with online video content than just watch it. Whether you're a student watching a lecture, a developer following a tutorial, or a researcher analyzing content, this extension provides the tools to engage deeply with the material.

The sidebar automatically detects the video you're playing and gives you a dedicated workspace to control playback, write down summaries, and bookmark key moments with timestamped, clickable notes. All your work is automatically saved and reloaded when you return to a video, keeping your research organized and accessible.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Smart Video Tracking:** Automatically detects the active YouTube video, even when you switch tabs.
- ‚èØÔ∏è **Convenient Playback Controls:** A "remote control" with icons to play/pause, rewind, and fast-forward the video without needing to be on the YouTube tab.
- üìä **Rich UI:** Displays the video's thumbnail, title, and a real-time progress bar.
- üìù **Persistent General Notes:** A dedicated space for free-form notes and summaries that are saved automatically for each video.
- üìå **Timestamped Highlights:** Instantly capture the current timestamp and add a specific, custom note for that moment.
- üñ±Ô∏è **Clickable Timestamps:** Jump directly to a bookmarked moment in the video by clicking on your highlight.
- üíæ **Automatic Saving:** All your notes and highlights are saved to your browser's local storage and reloaded when you revisit a video.

## Current Status & Roadmap

The core functionality of the extension is implemented and largely stable. All notes and controls work as intended.

However, there is a known synchronization bug that is currently being worked on:

- **The "Off-by-One" Bug:** When navigating between videos in the same tab, the sidebar UI is sometimes one step behind, showing the details of the previous video. This is the top priority to fix.

### Future Features

- [ ] **Fix Synchronization Bug:** Solve the "off-by-one" issue to ensure the UI is always perfectly in sync with the active video.
- [ ] **Export Functionality:** Implement a feature to export all notes and highlights for a video into a clean, portable format like Markdown (`.md`) or a text file (`.txt`).
- [ ] **Editable Highlights:** Allow users to edit the text of a highlight after it has been created.
- [ ] **Delete Notes/Highlights:** Add buttons to remove individual highlights or clear all notes for a video.
- [ ] **Search & Filter:** For videos with many highlights, add a search bar to filter notes.
